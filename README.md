This is a joke project made for a friend, and should not be taken seriously. :-)

It is also used as a learning project for using [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).

It should do as it says on the tin: ban people playing league for more than 30 minutes, though I haven't tested it on live league players (yet).
